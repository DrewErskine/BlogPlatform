# Blog Platform

## Description
This Blog Platform is a Spring Boot-based application designed to provide a simple yet robust platform for blogging. It supports operations to create, read, update, and delete blog posts and has been built using Java 21 and Spring Boot 3 to showcase modern Java development practices with a RESTful API design.

## Features
- CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
- Data Persistence: Utilizes MySQL for reliable data storage.
- RESTful API: Includes endpoints for managing blog posts.
- Basic Authentication: Optional feature that can be implemented for user authentication.
- Responsive Design: Supports a responsive front end if implemented.

## Technologies
- **Spring Boot 3**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Java 21**: Utilizes the latest features and security enhancements of Java.
- **MySQL**: Robust database management system for storing blog posts.
- **Maven**: Used for dependency management and project building.
 


## API Endpoints

Method      Endpoint	           Description
GET         /api/posts	        Retrieves all blog posts.
GET	      /api/posts/{id}	  Retrieves a blog post by ID.
POST	      /api/posts	        Creates a new blog post.
PUT	      /api/posts/{id}	  Updates an existing blog post.
DELETE	   /api/posts/{id}	  Deletes a blog post.


## Files
1. BlogApplication.java
Summary: This is the entry point of your Spring Boot application. It uses the @SpringBootApplication annotation which is a convenience annotation that includes @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan annotations with their default attributes.
Review: The file is correctly set up for a basic Spring Boot application.

2. LoginService.java
Summary: This service provides user authentication and registration functionality, implementing the UserDetailsService interface required for integrating with Spring Security.
Review: It's recommended to use a persistent database store for user information rather than an in-memory map for production. Also, you might consider not storing plaintext passwords even in a basic example.

3. PostService.java
Summary: Manages post data interactions, encapsulating business logic for handling posts.
Review: The implementation likely covers CRUD operations for posts. Ensure that all necessary business logic and validations are implemented here to keep controllers simple.

4. UserService.java
Summary: Manages user-related data and business rules.
Review: Similar to PostService, this service should handle all business logic related to users. Make sure methods like save handle all necessary logic for user validation, password encryption, etc.

1. PostRepository.java
Overview: This interface extends JpaRepository, providing CRUD operations for Post entities, and includes custom query methods.
Review: The repository includes methods to search posts by title and content using case-insensitive matching, which is great for a blog platform. The usage of @Query for custom SQL is appropriately implemented.

2. UserRepository.java
Overview: Extends JpaRepository for User entities, providing essential user operations.
Review: Includes methods to check existence by username and email, and to fetch a user by username. It's well-structured for managing user data access.

3. Post.java
Overview: This is an entity model for blog posts.
Review: Includes fields for id, title, content, and createdAt. Uses @Entity and @Table annotations correctly. Consider adding validation annotations like @NotNull for fields that shouldn't be empty.

4. User.java
Overview: Entity model for users.
Review: Likely contains fields for user details and credentials. Ensure that password handling in the entity is secure, possibly using transient fields for sensitive data that shouldn't persist.

5. CustomErrorController.java
Overview: A controller that likely handles custom error mappings.
Review: Ensure that it implements error handling correctly and provides useful feedback to users without exposing sensitive application details.

6. HomeController.java
Overview: Controls the main landing pages of the blog.
Review: Should manage routing to home or dashboard views. Ensure that it uses model attributes effectively and interacts properly with services for data retrieval.

7. PostController.java
Overview: Manages all post-related web interactions.
Review: Check that all HTTP methods are handled appropriately, CSRF protection is in place, and user input is validated both client-side and server-side.

8. UserController.java
Overview: Handles user-related actions like registration and profile management.
Review: Important to ensure secure handling of user data, proper validation, and use of services for business logic.

9. ApplicationConfig.java
Overview: Likely contains general application configurations.
Review: Check for appropriate configuration settings that optimize performance and functionality.

10. SecurityConfig.java
Overview: Configures security settings for the application.
Review: The file should define security rules like authentication providers, password encoding, and specific route protections. It's crucial to ensure that security settings are robust and prevent unauthorized access.







```
1. Domain Model Setup
User and Authority Models: Define your user (User or Account) and authority (Authority) models, similar to what you have in Account.java and Authority.java. Ensure your user model can store credentials securely (e.g., hashed passwords) and associate with roles or authorities.
Database Repositories: Implement repositories (UserRepository or AccountRepository, and AuthorityRepository) for accessing and manipulating user and authority data stored in the database.
2. Service Layer
UserDetailsService (MyUserDetailsService): Implement the UserDetailsService to load user details from the database by username (or email). This service should return a UserDetails object that includes username, password, and authorities.
User Registration Service: This service handles new user sign-ups. It should validate user data, encrypt passwords, and store the user in the database.
3. Security Configuration
Spring Security Configuration (WebSecurityConfig): Configure HTTP security, specifying URL access rules, form login parameters, logout configurations, and session management policies. Set up password encryption using a PasswordEncoder.
4. Controller Layer
Login Controller: Manages login requests and responses. It might simply rely on Spring Security's automatic handling or include custom logic for login success and failure actions.
Registration Controller: Handles registration requests by taking user data, validating it, and using the registration service to create new user accounts.
5. Authentication Process Implementation
Configuring Form Login: In your Spring Security configuration, set up form login to authenticate users. Specify the login processing URL, success handler, failure handler, and the page for the login form.
Custom Authentication Success and Failure Handlers: Implement these to manage redirection or other logic after login attempts.
6. Frontend
Login Page: Create a login form that submits credentials (username and password) to your login processing URL.
Registration Page: Design a registration form for new users to input their data, such as username, password, email, etc.
7. Database and Transaction Management
Ensure transaction management is properly configured in services that write to the database, particularly in user registration where multiple related entities might be updated or created.
8. Testing
Unit Tests: Write unit tests for your service layer, especially around user registration and user loading logic.
Integration Tests: Test your Spring Security configuration to ensure that the security rules are applied correctly and that endpoints are secured as expected.
9. Deployment Considerations
Secure Your Application: Before going live, ensure that all endpoints are secured, passwords are stored in hashed form, and any sensitive data is protected.
10. Maintenance and Logging
Audit and Logging: Implement logging and possibly auditing to track login attempts, registration, and other critical security-related actions.
